### polylang language switcher

Since I needed a completely different component from what was in the pro, so I decided to create my own language switcher for polylang, at the moment there is the component and the modal window as below (it is activated by clicking on a button that has the icon and the name of the language currently displayed).

If you use it or would like to continue my work (the dropdown is completely missing at the moment) I will be happy to accept your pull request!
